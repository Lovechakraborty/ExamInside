  Before this application, it was very difficult to maintain, manipulate and search of any students result’s history from the database.
Waste of hard pages: The another major waste of pages and space issues to store the whole papers of each streams.

# Why this PROJECT..?
It reduces the required time for generating an accurate result.
It can find particular students result of the previous semester with an efficient way.
Now there are no uses of hard pages that is reduce cost and storage space.
at last, to make a rhythm with this digitized generation we should update ourselves by using this kind of application.

# How much acceptable?
Nowadays it’s a challenge to make a balance With this modern technology and to make this possible we should update our selves as well as our methodology. This application is the one the methodology that provides us an ambiance that makes us fast and efficient for taking a test and make us more smarter. So we can say to go with this flow everybody will have to use this kind of smart application to make them more reliable.
